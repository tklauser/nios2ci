bit operation instructions
--------------------------

These are especially useful to be used in the Linux kernel in asm/bitops.h to
define the functions named correspondingly in Linux.

The following instructions are provided in the .vhd file named accordingly:

ffs
	find first (least-significat) set bit in a 32bit word
ffz
	find first (least-significat) zero bit in a 32bit word
fls
	find last (most-significant) set bit in a 32bit word
hweight
	hamming weight of a 32bit word
